# NN_Jet_Angle_Correlation
A code which uses the Nearest Neighbour algorithm to find correlation between the jet 
angles of sources. The code creates a histogram of the angle projections as well as a
theoretical line (model) for the completely random angle distribution, for comparison.

The catalogue must contain 3D cartesian coordinates X, Y, Z and the jet angle value
(called RPA or Radio Position Angle in the code).

Te code requires the user to create folders called "Input" and "Output_Plot" in the 
same folder where the code is located.
